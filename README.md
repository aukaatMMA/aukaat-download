# 🏆 Aukaat 1v1 Tournament App

An experimental side project turned into a growing platform for 1v1 ARAM tournaments — built with love, gaming spirit, and a healthy dose of post-game brainstorming.

Originally developed solo by **[gabruuuuu](https://github.com/gabru-md)**, Aukaat was tested with a small inner-circle tournament. The response was solid, the vibe was strong, and the idea showed real potential. That’s when a couple of friends joined to help scale things beyond the MVP.

## 👥 The Team

- **[gabruuuuu](https://github.com/gabru-md)** –  Started the original concept and solo MVP.

## 🚀 The Vision

We’re building a lightweight, Riot-friendly web app to host global 1v1 ARAM tournaments.  
It should be:

- Easy to join and play
- Competitive but chill
- Fully automated — from signup to match tracking
- Capable of scaling to hundreds (eventually thousands?) of players

The dream? To make 1v1s a thing and have a lot of fun!

## 🧪 Current Status

- ✅ MVP complete and used in a closed mini-tournament
- 🔧 Full app architecture (frontend + serverless backend) in progress
- 🧑‍🔬 Private beta testing with invited players
- 📈 Preparing for a bigger internal launch soon

## 🙌 Thanks
